# Do you want to become a Software Engineer?

Well, you've come to the right place 🤝

This is a collection of (mostly) technical things every software engineer (or developer lol) should know.

👇 _These are resources I can recommend to every programmer regardless of their skill level or tech stack_

_P.S. You won't all of this by heart to be a programmer.
But knowing this stuff will most certainly help you become a better engineer! 💪_

_P.P.S. [Contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome!_

## What is this?

We fully understand that no-one has time to do a couple hundred Leetcode questions. Therefore, we have presented you with a _curated_ list of technical interview preparation materials. Following this list and familiarising yourselves with the content will enable you to be ready to smash any technical interview.

## Who is this for?

This is geared towards anyone who wants to land their dream job at a tech company.

Individuals reading this repository can come from completely non-computer science backgrounds, they may also be seasoned engineers who have not been on the other side of the interviewing table for some time.

We will ensure that everyone puts themselves in a strong position to land their dream job!

Anybody who wants to land a job at a tech company but is new to technical interviews, seasoned engineers who have not been on the other side of the interviewing table in a while and want to get back into the game, or anyone who wants to be better at technical interviewing.

# How is this repository different?

There are so many great books like [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) and interview-related repositories out there on GitHub. So, what makes this repository different?

The key difference is that a lot of these repositories contain links to external resources, whereas we will aim to provide you with content right here, directly at your disposal.

Additionally, the vast majority of existing resources mainly focus on algorithmic questions and fail to cover core concepts such as systems designs, agile methodologies, front end development etc.

This guide aims to cover content beyond the typical algorithmic coding questions. 😎

## Looking for front-end content?

We will be diving deep into advanced concepts such as state management, css pre-processors, higher order functions and much more!

## Looking for systems design content?

Look no further! We will be covering core distributed computing concepts which will allow you to build scalable, fault-tolerant and highly available systems from scratch. We will be diving deep into topics like:

- Replication
- Leader Election
- Caching
- Database Design
- Security and much more!

_Good luck_
